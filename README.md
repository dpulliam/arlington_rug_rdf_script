# Arlington RUG Demo A Script

This demo is intended to show the basic use of RDF and Linkeddata gems. This was done as a part of the "Beyond Human: Rails and the Semantic Web" talk. 

## Goals
 * Illustrate basic graph creation and dumping
 * Illustrate more advanced graph example with query
 * Show the objects queried through google maps
 * Load external vocabulary

## How To Use

1. git clone git@github.com:dpulliam/arlington_rug_rdf_script.git
2. start up irb
3. It would probably be best to run chunks of the script at a time rather than the whole file

## Gems
 * [rdf](https://github.com/ruby-rdf/rdf)
 * [linkeddata](https://github.com/ruby-rdf/linkeddata)
